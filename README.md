# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Perform an exploratory analysis creating a variety of charts to help PyBer improve ridesharing access and affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Through the analysis I showcase the difference in total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and total fare by city. 


## Results

### Total Rides
The urban cities have 1625 total rides

The suburban cities have 625 total rides

The rural cities have 125 total rides

The urban cities make up 68.4% of the total combined rides.

### Total Drivers 
The urban cities have 2405 total drivers

The suburban cities have 490 total drivers

The rural cities have 78 total drivers

This explains why there are more rides in the urban cities because there are more drivers compared to rural cities. 


### Total Fares
The urban cities have a total fare of $39,854.38
The suburban cities have a total fare of $19,356.33
The rural cities have a total fare of $4,327.93

The urban cities bring in the most revenue. 


### Average Fare per Ride
The average fare per ride in urban cities is $24.53

The average fare per ride in suburban cities is $30.97

The average fare per ride in rural cities is $34.62

Rural cities have the least number of rides but the highest average fare per ride.


### Average Fare per Driver
The average fare per drive in urban cities is $16.57

The average fare per driver in suburban cities is $39.50

The average fare per driver in rural cities is $55.49

Again, rural cities have the highest average. The average for rural cities is $38.92 more than the average for urban cities. 


### Total fare by city

## Summary

The following are recommendations for the company that I believe will be beneficial after conducting my analysis. 

1.	Rural cities have the least number of rides but the highest average fare per ride and per driver. Finding ways to reduce these averages closer to the urban city averages may encourage people in these areas to take more rides and also become drivers. Typically stores or places to frequent are more spread out in rural areas therefore there is a need for PyBer but the high cost for both rider and driver are steering people away. 
2.	Urban cities bring in the most revenue. Research should be done in these areas to determine if it is low average costs per ride or convenience due to the type of city that cause more total rides, revenue, and drivers. If it is just convenience then PyBer may have an opportunity to raise prices in these areas allowing for the cut in pricing in rural areas not to affect the companyâ€™s bottom line while the areas begin to grow. 
3.	Focus advertising and incentives on the rural areas to increase participation and awareness.
